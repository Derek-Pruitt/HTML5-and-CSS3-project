		<blockquote cite="https://www.gfinityesports.com/article/3900/mw2-campaign-remastered-best-quotes-in-modern-warfare-2">
					Captain Price: This is for the record. History is written by the victor.History is filled with liars. If he lives and we die, his truth becomes written - and ours is lost.Shepherd will a hero, 'cause all you need to change the world is one good lie and a river of blood. He's about to complete the greatest trick a liar ever played on history. His truth will be the truth.But only if he lives, and we die.
